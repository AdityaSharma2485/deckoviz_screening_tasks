Name: Noura El Tayeb
Age: 24
Location: Khartoum, Sudan (currently Cairo, Egypt)
Profession: Radio Producer, Community News, coordinates segments on health, education, and migration for a diaspora audience.

Backstory: Noura grew up falling asleep to a battery-powered radio during blackouts. She learned that voices carry comfort and instruction when lights don’t. University protests taught her the risk and responsibility of information. Relocation to Cairo turned her into a bridge for families split by borders and patchy signals.

Core Motivation: To deliver trustworthy, practical information that helps people make small, lifesaving decisions under uncertainty.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears amplifying rumors in a rush. She worries about sources’ safety. She’s insecure about her editing speed and practices nightly.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Field Recording Markets: Captures vendor calls and rhythms to ground segments in place.
- Arabic Poetry Slams: Performs and edits words down to the bone.
- Tea Rituals: Hosts colleagues after late shows; shared sugar repairs frayed nerves.

Media Diet:

- Reads local NGO bulletins and WHO advisories.
- Listens to BBC Africa and small community stations.
- Watches mobile journalism tutorials and low-bandwidth streaming hacks.

Communication Style: Warm, concise, and rhythmic. She scripts with active verbs and clear calls to action.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a drawer of fresh batteries labeled by date and a superstition that new shows need new power.

Bio & Current Focus: Noura’s studio is a nest of cables, sticky notes with phonetic name spellings, and a wall map with pins marking caller locations. She builds episodes around “today decisions”—clinic hours, bus routes, document checklists—braiding in songs that carry memory. After a misinformation wave about vaccines, she paired a trusted grandmother’s voice with a doctor’s, honoring both authority types. She’s piloting voice note call-ins via WhatsApp to reduce call costs and widen participation. Her current series follows students navigating foreign credential recognition, offering step-by-steps instead of pity. She times her tea to steep during ad breaks, a small ritual in a life tuned to seconds.
