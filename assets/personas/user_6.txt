Name: Sara Haddad
Age: 36
Location: Marseille, France
Profession: Marine Ecologist, Port Authority Consultant, designs biodiversity monitoring programs around urban harbors.

Backstory: Sara grew up in a fishing family that watched catches thin year by year. A scholarship took her to a coastal lab where she learned to tag fish and model currents, discovering that policy meetings often needed translators more than scientists. She returned to the working docks, determined to make ecology speak in calendars and fuel costs. Her office smells faintly of salt and diesel, which she insists is the scent of honest negotiation.

Core Motivation: To make environmental stewardship pragmatic and profitable enough that it becomes routine rather than heroic.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears being dismissed as a romantic by harbor operators and as a sellout by activists. Nightmares include a spill she could have prevented with one more meeting. She’s insecure about her math under pressure.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Freediving: Finds quiet perspective under the noise line; it reminds her what the port sounds like to fish.
- Urban Sketching: Draws cranes and hulls at dusk, practicing observation without intervention.
- Pickling: Ferments sardines and vegetables; preserving abundance feels like defiance against scarcity.

Media Diet:

- Reads ICES Journal of Marine Science and EU directives on water quality.
- Listens to "The Documentary" from BBC World Service for policy context.
- Follows small-boat YouTube channels to understand practical seamanship.

Communication Style: Direct and comparative. She converts ecological impact into downtime and maintenance costs without apology.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a jar of clean sand from every site visit lined up on her windowsill, labeled with duct tape and a Sharpie.

Bio & Current Focus: Sara’s strength is making fragile ecosystems legible to people who move metal for a living. She sketches mitigation plans on the backs of delivery receipts and brings hot coffee to early shift supervisors to win honest feedback. After a storm surge flooded a quay, she built a pilot program tying eelgrass restoration to reduced sediment dredging, framing habitat as infrastructure. She’s currently assembling a consortium bid to monitor noise pollution with cheap hydrophones, betting that the data will justify rerouting at night. On weekends she dives with friends, and on Mondays she argues for decibel caps—two sides of the same fidelity to a working sea.
