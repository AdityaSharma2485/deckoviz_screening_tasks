Name: Keisha Thompson
Age: 48
Location: Atlanta, USA
Profession: Hospice Nurse Manager, Home Care, oversees teams delivering end-of-life care and coordinates with families, insurers, and physicians.

Backstory: Keisha helped raise her siblings while her mother worked nights, learning adult logistics early. A clinical rotation in hospice revealed medicine that centers comfort and truth-telling. She found she had a gift for difficult conversations and practical tenderness—managing pain pumps and expectations with equal care. Management was a reluctant step she took to multiply good care, not to leave the bedside.

Core Motivation: To make the last chapter honest, comfortable, and free of avoidable bureaucracy.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears missing a symptom that could have been managed better. She worries about staff burning out on grief. She’s insecure about spreadsheets and leans on her coordinator for billing quirks.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Gospel Choir: Singing in harmonies restores her breath after heavy days.
- Porch Gardening: Grows lavender and mint for tea kits she brings to families.
- Jigsaw Puzzles: Quiet ritual that reminds her every piece has a place.

Media Diet:

- Reads JAMA palliative care papers and Medicare updates.
- Listens to "Terrible, Thanks for Asking" and pastoral care podcasts.
- Watches cooking shows that require patience rather than drama.

Communication Style: Warm, direct, and paced. She uses plain language and pauses, allowing families to catch up.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a small basket of soft socks in her trunk; cold feet are an easy kindness to fix.

Bio & Current Focus: Keisha triages chaos into care plans. Her day is a braid of medication reconciliations, caregiver training, and insurance forms no one has time for. After a family was surprised by a hospice discharge, she instituted a “last 48 hours” briefing that sets expectations and reduces panic. She is building a mentorship program that pairs new nurses with seasoned ones for debriefs after tough visits. A new electronic charting system threatens to slow the team; she’s negotiating templates that capture nuance without adding clicks. On Sundays she sings, lets tears fall when they need to, and fills her car with lavender kits for Monday.
