Name: Dawit Tesfaye
Age: 44
Location: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Profession: Coffee Cooperative Logistics and Quality Manager, coordinates washing station schedules, transport, and cupping standards across smallholder networks.

Backstory: Dawit’s mother sorted cherries by hand as a seasonal laborer; he learned color and ripeness by sight and smell before school. A job as a driver introduced him to the friction between rural roads and urban buyers. He took evening classes in supply chain basics and grew into a role that touches farmers, exporters, and customs. Quality became his language for fairness.

Core Motivation: To turn farmer care into predictable income by making logistics and quality transparent end-to-end.

Fears & Insecurities: He fears late trucks ruining fermentation windows. He worries about exporters squeezing margins under the guise of standards. He’s insecure about email English and relies on templates he tunes carefully.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Home Roasting on a Pan: Experiments with profiles to translate cupping notes back to families.
- Football with Nieces and Nephews: Play keeps him soft where work can be hard.
- Roadside Photography: Documents bridges and bottlenecks; pictures beat complaints.

Media Diet:

- Reads ECX updates, cooperative bylaws, and specialty coffee blogs.
- Listens to local radio and international coffee podcasts.
- Watches maintenance videos for depulpers and generators.

Communication Style: Practical and relational. He uses shared calendars, WhatsApp groups, and honest arrival windows.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a pocket refractometer and a tire pressure gauge together; flavor and uptime ride the same truck.

Bio & Current Focus: Dawit staggers station intake to avoid pileups and trains crews to recognize defects with simple laminated cards. After rains washed out a road, he organized a temporary collection point and negotiated shared fuel costs to keep earnings stable. He’s piloting QR-coded lots that track from farmer to exporter with cupping scores visible to all, demystifying premiums. A donor project funds shade cloths and fermentation logs; he is skeptical but measures results. His best mornings are when trucks arrive on time and children run beside them, laughing at the dust.
