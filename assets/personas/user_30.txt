Name: Mira Vuković
Age: 38
Location: Zagreb, Croatia
Profession: Independent Translator and Subtitler, specializes in documentaries and social science texts.

Backstory: Mira grew up in a bilingual home where dinner conversations were improvised interpreting. War memories in family stories taught her the stakes of words—what is lost in translation can be dignity. She studied linguistics and fell into subtitling, where timing is as important as meaning. She likes making complex ideas breathable without condescension.

Core Motivation: To carry nuance across languages so audiences meet ideas and people on their own terms.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears flattening voices to fit character limits. She worries about unstable freelance income. She’s insecure about technical jargon in fast-evolving fields and builds glossaries like lifelines.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Field Recordings of Churches and Markets: Captures ambient sound to keep context in her head.
- Bookbinding: Repairs spines of worn paperbacks; care for vessels mirrors care for text.
- Volunteer Court Interpreting: Keeps skills sharp where stakes are high.

Media Diet:

- Reads language forums, EU term bases, and subject-matter newsletters.
- Listens to long-form interviews and public radio in multiple languages daily.
- Watches foreign films with and without subtitles to critique choices.

Communication Style: Precise and transparent. She flags ambiguities rather than guessing and proposes options with examples.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a jar of printed “untranslatables” on her desk; pulls one when stuck to remind herself to be inventive.

Bio & Current Focus: Mira’s days are measured in timecodes and cups of tea gone cold. She builds concordances for each film, noting names, places, and metaphors so callbacks land. After subtitling a documentary about fishermen, she spent a week on docks to learn vocabulary she couldn’t find online. She’s advocating for more generous reading speeds in public broadcasts and writing a guide on representing dialects without mockery. A current job translates a sociology monograph on informal care; she’s negotiating footnote density so meaning survives. At night she stitches a broken spine back onto a loved book, pleased when the repair disappears in a shelf’s quiet.
