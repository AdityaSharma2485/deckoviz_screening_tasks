Name: Farah Qureshi
Age: 31
Location: Karachi, Pakistan
Profession: Pharmacovigilance Specialist, Generics Manufacturer, monitors adverse event reports and coordinates safety labeling changes across markets.

Backstory: Farah watched her diabetic father navigate medications with a pharmacist’s guidance more than a doctor’s. In pharmacy school she preferred case narratives over compounding, drawn to the detective work of side effects. A residency exposed her to how culture and literacy shape reporting. Industry offered scale; she took it reluctantly and learned to build conscience into process.

Core Motivation: To make medicines safer in practice, not just in trials, by listening to what patients and pharmacists actually report.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears missing a signal buried in noise. She worries about legal risk overshadowing patient risk. She’s insecure about presenting to regulators and practices dry runs at home.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Calligraphy with Recycled Paper: Finds clarity in deliberate strokes; it balances her alert inbox.
- Birding at Dawn in Korangi Creek: Watching egrets teaches patience for rare events.
- Urdu Short Stories: Hosts a reading group; narratives sharpen her attention to human detail.

Media Diet:

- Reads WHO signal detection guidelines and local Drug Regulatory Authority notices.
- Listens to "The BMJ Podcast" and pharmacology lectures.
- Watches statistical tutorials on disproportionality analysis and R Shiny demos.

Communication Style: Methodical and empathetic. She pairs charts with short case vignettes to keep stakes present.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a bowl of assorted placebo tablets on her desk to demonstrate pill size and shape in meetings.

Bio & Current Focus: Farah’s week is a loop of triaging ICSRs, running signal detection, and drafting label changes that lawyers won’t sand smooth. After a cluster of dizziness reports tied to a packaging change, she pushed for a redesign that improved grip for older hands. She’s building pharmacy partnerships to capture near-misses that never reach formal systems. A current project translates key adverse effects into pictograms for low-literacy inserts without dumbing down nuance. She still calls the neighborhood pharmacist who helped her father, testing whether her policies would have helped in that tiny shop.
