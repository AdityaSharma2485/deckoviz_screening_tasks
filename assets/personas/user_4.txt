Name: Elijah Brooks
Age: 52
Location: Detroit, USA
Profession: Automotive Upholsterer and Shop Owner, restores classic car interiors and custom seats for small manufacturers.

Backstory: Elijah learned to stitch vinyl in his uncle’s garage in the 1990s, when layoffs made side hustles survival. He watched neighbors keep old cars alive through ingenuity and patience. A factory job gave him steady pay but little pride, until a layoff nudged him back into craft. He rebuilt a ’68 Impala interior for a neighbor and never returned to the line.

Core Motivation: To preserve and adapt a working-class craft so it can still feed families in a city that’s reinventing itself.

Fears & Insecurities: He fears losing the dexterity in his hands that anchors his identity. He’s wary of becoming a boutique shop that prices out the very people who taught him. He worries he’s behind on digital marketing.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Blues Harmonica: Late-night riffs help him listen for rhythm in a stitch line.
- Rebuilding Jukeboxes: Loves bringing back the physical click of selection buttons; it’s tactile history.
- Sunday Barber Shop Chess: Strategic patience learned over pawns shows up in his quotes and timelines.

Media Diet:

- Reads Hemmings Motor News for parts and stories.
- Listens to "Shop Talk Live" and "Sewing with Nancy" reruns for techniques.
- Watches Anthony Bourdain’s "Parts Unknown" for its respect for place and labor.

Communication Style: Plainspoken and steady. He gives ranges, not promises, and follows up with photos rather than adjectives.

Quirk or Contradiction: Refuses to use a tape measure for certain jobs—swears by a frayed length of string with pencil marks from his uncle.

Bio & Current Focus: Elijah runs a small shop where invoices share a corkboard with Polaroids of finished cars and handwritten thank-yous. He mentors a couple of teenagers after school, insisting they bill hours because skill without pay is a hobby. A new contract with an EV startup has him experimenting with plant-based foams that behave differently under tension. He’s balancing that R&D with a backlog of community jobs, like a church van that needs dignity more than show. He’s building a pricing model that subsidizes essentials from custom work, trying to keep his door open to everyone. At night, he oils his hands like tools, aware that the craft and the body are one.
