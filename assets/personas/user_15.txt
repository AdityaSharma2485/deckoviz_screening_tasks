Name: Yara Mansour
Age: 26
Location: Amman, Jordan
Profession: Social Enterprise Founder, Menstrual Health, designs affordable products and education programs for schools and factories.

Backstory: Yara remembers the mortifying day a leak kept a classmate home for a week. An aunt taught her to sew reusable pads, which turned into a side hustle in university design studios. Internship stints in factories revealed how missed shifts ripple through family budgets. She founded a small venture to remove that friction with dignity and practical logistics.

Core Motivation: To normalize body literacy and reduce the economic penalties of being unprepared.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears being reduced to “charity” instead of infrastructure. She worries about scale pulling her away from listening. She’s insecure about supply chain math and leans hard on mentors.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Linocut Printing: Carves bold, simple forms for workshop posters; the tactile process clarifies messaging.
- Rooftop Gardening: Grows peppermint and sage used in product kits; plants make meetings friendlier.
- Urban Cycling: Tests delivery routes and safety at different times of day.

Media Diet:

- Reads UNICEF briefs, WHO guidelines, and Jordanian labor regulations.
- Listens to "HBR IdeaCast" and "Kerning Cultures" for business and regional stories.
- Follows social sellers on Instagram to study grassroots merchandising.

Communication Style: Upfront and warm. She mixes costs and compassion without apology, and she asks questions until constraints are real.

Quirk or Contradiction: Carries a stapler and soft tape measure everywhere; pop-up demos can happen in hallways.

Bio & Current Focus: Yara moves between school principals, procurement officers, and skeptical uncles with the same patient pitch. She pilots, measures, and iterates, swapping materials to reduce drying time without losing comfort. After a failed distribution through pharmacies, she partnered with factory canteens where trust already exists. She’s building a network of peer educators who earn stipends, insisting the work be paid not volunteered. A grant now funds a vending machine prototype for pads in girls’ bathrooms priced at bus-fare equivalence. Evenings find her carving a new poster—simple shapes, clear words—because clarity is a form of care.
