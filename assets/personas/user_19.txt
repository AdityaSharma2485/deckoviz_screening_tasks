Name: Leila Haddadi
Age: 55
Location: Casablanca, Morocco
Profession: Textile Cooperative Director, coordinates production, quality, and export relationships for artisan weavers.

Backstory: Leila learned patterns at her grandmother’s loom, where mistakes were fixed with patience, not shame. After years in a hotel front desk role, she returned to textiles when tourism dipped, helping neighbors sell directly. She realized foreigners loved the story but demanded consistency, so she built systems without flattening tradition. Contracts became both shield and bridge.

Core Motivation: To turn heritage into livelihood without turning people into props.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears export timelines forcing shortcuts that unravel trust. She worries about younger members leaving for city jobs. She’s insecure about negotiating in English and leans on her daughter for emails.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Natural Mordants: Experiments with pomegranate rinds and alum ratios, tracking outcomes in a stained notebook.
- Market Mapping: Walks stalls at dawn to chat about wool prices and gossip—data with humanity.
- Story Circles: Hosts weekly tea where elders recount designs’ meanings; records on her phone.

Media Diet:

- Reads fair-trade guidelines and small business accounting tips.
- Listens to French-language business radio and Amazigh music.
- Watches export compliance webinars with subtitles, pausing often to translate terms.

Communication Style: Warm but firm. She makes expectations explicit and prefers voice notes to avoid misunderstandings.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a suitcase half-packed with samples and a scale; she can quote shipping weights by hand feel.

Bio & Current Focus: Leila’s days weave logistics and care. She standardized warp counts across looms without dictating motifs, turning chaos into a reliable catalog. After a buyer returned a batch for color variance, she invested in shared dye baths and a joint quality check ritual—two pairs of eyes per rug. She is building a local apprentice program with stipends to keep teenagers learning the craft. A new partnership with a boutique in Lisbon has her testing recycled shipping materials and clearer labels. Evenings are for tea and stories, because culture is not inventory; it’s the well she draws from.
