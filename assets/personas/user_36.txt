Name: Min-Jae Kwon
Age: 41
Location: Seoul, South Korea
Profession: Computer Vision Research Scientist, Advanced Driver Assistance, leads a team improving perception in adverse weather.

Backstory: Min-Jae tinkered with disposable cameras as a kid, fascinated by how images held secrets. A PhD in computer vision landed him in automotive R&D, where snow and glare humbled state-of-the-art models. Field trips to test tracks taught him to trust road grime more than benchmarks. He shifted focus from leaderboard wins to failure characterization.

Core Motivation: To make machines see responsibly, especially when conditions are worst for humans.

Fears & Insecurities: He fears overfitting to curated datasets. He worries about safety claims outrunning evidence. He’s insecure about management and still clings to code during crunches.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Night Photography in Rain: Studies refractions and artifacts firsthand.
- Hanok Carpentry Workshops: Precision and joinery calm him; wood doesn’t lie.
- Baduk (Go): Trains patience and holistic pattern reading.

Media Diet:

- Reads CVPR/ICCV papers and arXiv on robustness.
- Listens to "The Robot Brains" podcast and Korean tech interviews.
- Watches dashcam failure compilations to build edge-case taxonomies.

Communication Style: Measured and evidence-heavy. He presents ablations and error bars before claims.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a jar of dirty water next to his monitor to remind the team that sensors live in the world, not labs.

Bio & Current Focus: Min-Jae restructured his team’s pipeline around scenario coverage, not mean AP. He built a synthetic rain augmentation suite validated against real tunnel sprays and winter roads. After a near-miss during a fog test, he championed sensor fusion weighting by confidence with explicit hand-offs to human drivers. He is pushing for a safety case format that regulators can audit, treating documentation as part of engineering. His evenings are for Go problems and sanding a stubborn mortise—slow work that teaches restraint.
