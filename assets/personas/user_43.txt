Name: Aaliyah Johnson
Age: 22
Location: Chicago, USA
Profession: Community College Student and Night Shift Package Sorter, studying respiratory therapy while supporting her grandmother.

Backstory: Aaliyah grew up in a two-bedroom apartment filled with cousins and gospel radio. When asthma sent her little brother to the ER, a calm respiratory therapist felt like a superhero. She started night shifts after high school to pay for classes, learning to move her body like a machine without losing kindness. School is slower than she hoped, but her grit is steady.

Core Motivation: To earn a stable healthcare role that lets her take care of family without choosing between bills and breath.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears failing anatomy and wasting money. She worries about missing a shift and losing hours. She’s insecure about asking questions in class and compensates with office hours.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Thrift Flips: Mends and resells clothes; stitches are small wins.
- Sunday Choir: Singing fills her lungs and reminds her what she’s chasing.
- YouTube Study Vlogs: Uses Pomodoro videos to stay awake and feel less alone.

Media Diet:

- Reads class textbooks and discount flyers.
- Listens to nursing podcasts on commutes.
- Watches Khan Academy and RegisteredNurseRN tutorials at 2x.

Communication Style: Straightforward and warm. She asks what “good” looks like and writes steps down.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a tiny bottle of Vicks in her pocket; scent cues focus before exams.

Bio & Current Focus: Aaliyah’s life is a calendar taped to the fridge: shifts in green, classes in blue, grandma’s appointments in red. She preps flashcards at lunch on the sorting line and reviews them waiting for the bus, choosing diligence over drama. When a coworker wheezed in the cold, she coached pursed-lip breathing like she’d seen on video, surprised at her own authority. She’s saving for exam fees one overtime shift at a time. The dream is simple: a badge, a steady schedule, and breath steady in the family.
