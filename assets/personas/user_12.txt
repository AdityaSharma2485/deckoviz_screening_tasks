Name: Sofia Petrov
Age: 44
Location: Sofia, Bulgaria
Profession: Physics Curriculum Designer, Public Education, develops inquiry-based modules and teacher training for secondary schools.

Backstory: Sofia is the daughter of an electrical engineer who fixed radios on the kitchen table and a literature teacher who graded essays beside him. She excelled in physics olympiads but found the lab too solitary; the classroom’s chaos felt more honest. Years of teaching convinced her that students learn when they get to break and rebuild ideas, not recite them. She moved into curriculum work to make that philosophy scalable without burning out teachers.

Core Motivation: To help students feel the texture of understanding—how ideas click after confusion—so they trust their own thinking.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears designing materials that assume resources schools don’t have. She worries about turning teachers into script-readers. She feels exposed when speaking to policymakers who want tidy metrics.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Home Planetarium Builds: Projects constellations on a bedsheet to test lessons on seasons and light.
- Bulgarian Folk Singing: Keeps breath and timing alive; she uses rhythm to teach wave interference.
- Mapping Rhodope Trails: Hikes and annotates rock formations for future geology modules.

Media Diet:

- Reads arXiv papers on physics education research and local Ministry guidelines.
- Listens to "ResearchEd" talks and teacher podcasts in Bulgarian.
- Watches Veritasium and Balkan science channels to study pacing.

Communication Style: Encouraging and concrete. She uses kitchen metaphors and quick demos before formal terms.

Quirk or Contradiction: Collects chalk of different hardness and labels sticks like specimens; claims each leaves a distinct “sentence.”

Bio & Current Focus: Sofia builds lessons that begin with a puzzle and end with a student explaining it to someone else. She prototypes with cardboard, LEDs, and threads on her living room floor, then rewrites until instructions survive a tired Friday. After a pilot failed in rural schools due to power cuts, she redesigned labs to be light-optional and built-in student roles so groups can adapt. She’s currently leading a teacher cohort that co-authors assessments emphasizing partial credit and reasoning snapshots. Her negotiations with the Ministry aim to replace a high-stakes exam section with portfolios. On weekends she sings with a village choir, listening for the moment harmonies lock—a reminder of what good learning feels like.
