Name: Siobhán O'Rourke
Age: 58
Location: Dublin, Ireland
Profession: Deaf Interpreter and Accessibility Consultant, specializes in Irish Sign Language (ISL) interpretation for courts, hospitals, and broadcast, and advises organizations on accessible service design.

Backstory: Siobhán was born Deaf into a hearing family that learned ISL alongside her first words, a rare grace that set her standard for inclusion. As a teenager, she interpreted informally at doctor visits until she met a professional DI who showed her the difference between helping and being trained to help. She certified, then spent decades in high-stakes rooms where accuracy meets power—courtrooms, emergency wards, live television. Consulting emerged when she realized many access failures are designed into forms and rooms, not just missing interpreters.

Core Motivation: To ensure Deaf people control their own narratives by guaranteeing communication that is accurate, timely, and dignified.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears vicarious trauma from repeated exposure to crises without proper debrief. She worries about younger interpreters being pushed into unsafe gigs alone. She’s insecure about technology shifting faster than training budgets.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Sea Swimming at Forty Foot: Cold water resets her nervous system after intense assignments.
- Traditional Irish Baking: Soda bread and porter cake rituals steady family rhythms.
- Garden Photography: Macro shots of moss and lichen satisfy her eye for nuance.

Media Diet:

- Reads accessibility standards (WCAG), court interpreting guidelines, and HSE updates.
- Watches ISL news broadcasts to critique pacing and framing.
- Follows Deaf creators and linguists on social media for evolving sign usage.

Communication Style: Clear, paced, and presence-forward. She manages turn-taking with gentle authority and states boundaries explicitly.

Quirk or Contradiction: Carries a small ring light in her bag; good lighting is access, and she’ll fix a room if facilities won’t.

Bio & Current Focus: Siobhán treats access as architecture, not an afterthought. She helped redesign a maternity ward intake so interpreters can be looped in without gossip or delay, adding simple flags and pre-consent options. After a chaotic televised debate, she advocated for camera framing that shows interpreters fully and a brief with key terminology in advance. She mentors Deaf interpreters entering legal settings, pairing them with experienced teams and structured debriefs. Her current consultancy project audits a city’s emergency alert system for sign-supported video and plain language. On Sundays, she bakes, swims, and writes notes toward a guidebook for hospitals—practical, human, and stubborn about dignity.
