Name: Camille Dupont
Age: 34
Location: Lyon, France
Profession: Food Systems Researcher, Municipality, designs and evaluates policies for reducing food waste and improving school meal nutrition.

Backstory: Camille’s grandparents ran a small bakery where leftovers became bread pudding, never trash. As a student she worked in a university cafeteria and saw how procurement rules create waste factories. A master’s in public policy taught her to speak budget, but the kitchen taught her what kids actually eat. She bridged both by focusing on menus that respect appetite and logistics.

Core Motivation: To make public meals nourishing, delightful, and frugal without shifting burden onto exhausted staff.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears policy fads that ignore cooks’ reality. She worries about sacrificing flavor in pursuit of nutrition scores. She’s insecure about confrontations with vendors who underdeliver.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Fermentation Club: Runs a neighborhood swap of krauts and pickles, celebrating preservation.
- Urban Foraging: Weekend walks to identify edible greens, bringing curiosity to menus.
- Food Photography: Documents school lunches and plate waste, making data visual and accountable.

Media Diet:

- Reads Appetite and public procurement bulletins.
- Listens to "Gastropod" and French public radio on agriculture.
- Follows school nutritionists on social media to spot workable ideas.

Communication Style: Empathetic and iterative. She prototypes changes in one school and scales slowly, inviting feedback.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a pocket refractometer to measure Brix in fruit; calls it her joy meter.

Bio & Current Focus: Camille’s office wall is covered with heatmaps of plate waste and sticky notes from kitchen staff. After students rejected a lentil dish, she brought cooks and a local chef together to rethink texture and spices, salvaging both nutrition and pride. She’s piloting a rotating “taste day” that introduces unfamiliar foods in tiny portions with stories attached. Procurement-wise, she’s proposing contracts that reward reduced waste rather than volume. Her current study tests the impact of serving order—salad first vs. last—on actual consumption. She ends most days with a jar of fermenting carrots on her desk, a quiet reminder that time is an ingredient.
