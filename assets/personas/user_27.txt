Name: Beatriz Campos
Age: 53
Location: Lisbon, Portugal
Profession: Museum Visitor Experience Director, designs flow, signage, and programs to make exhibits legible and welcoming.

Backstory: Beatriz worked as a ticketing clerk during art school and found herself drawn to the choreography of crowds more than canvases. A mentor taught her that hospitality is interpretation, not just service. She moved into management to fix small frictions that ruin visits—confusing bathrooms, bad lighting, unfriendly guards. She treats museums as public living rooms.

Core Motivation: To make art and history feel like they belong to everyone who walks in, not just those who studied the language.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears accessibility becoming a checkbox. She worries about staff morale when budgets tighten. She’s insecure about digital strategy and prefers physical prototypes.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Typography Walks: Photographs street signs and kerning sins; type choices shape tone.
- Fado Nights: Hosts listening sessions where lyrics are translated and argued.
- Herb Garden: Grows rosemary and bay used in café soups, insisting taste is part of the visit.

Media Diet:

- Reads MuseumNext and service design case studies.
- Listens to "99% Invisible" and Portuguese cultural policy shows.
- Watches queue management experiments and lighting demos.

Communication Style: Warm and directive. She uses floor tape and cardboard before any contractor is called.

Quirk or Contradiction: Carries sample soap and paper towels to test sinks; bad handwashing ruins goodwill.

Bio & Current Focus: Beatriz maps visitor journeys with empathy for strollers, wheelchairs, and impatient teens. After a blockbuster show created lines in the rain, she installed a timed-entry canopy of shade sails that doubled as a sculptural welcome. She’s piloting multilingual audio guides recorded by community members, trading polish for trust. A renovation has her fighting for more benches and clear sightlines rather than another café expansion. She measures success in linger time and smiles at guards who report fewer “lost” questions.
