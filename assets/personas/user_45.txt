Name: Diego Fernández
Age: 59
Location: Córdoba, Argentina
Profession: Public Bus Driver and Union Steward, advocates for safety schedules and passenger dignity.

Backstory: Diego started as a mechanic’s assistant and moved to driving because he preferred roads to grease. He watched routes expand without adding layover time, turning punctuality into punishment. When a friend nodded off at the wheel, he ran for union steward and learned to negotiate without burning bridges. His pride is a bus that feels safe day and night.

Core Motivation: To keep drivers and passengers safe by insisting that time, rest, and respect are non-negotiable parts of service.

Fears & Insecurities: He fears a fatal accident on his watch. He worries about being painted as “anti-progress” when he questions shiny tech. He’s insecure about email threads and prefers face-to-face meetings.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Mate Circles at Depots: Builds solidarity and hears small grievances before they explode.
- Classic Rock Vinyl: Cleans records like he checks mirrors; rituals matter.
- River Fishing: Stillness teaches patience for negotiations.

Media Diet:

- Reads labor law updates and municipal transit plans.
- Listens to football radio and traffic reports.
- Watches bus driver dashcam channels for defensive driving tips.

Communication Style: Direct and paternal. He remembers names and birthdays and speaks with calm authority.

Quirk or Contradiction: Carries a small egg timer to demonstrate realistic dwell times in meetings; sand beats spreadsheets.

Bio & Current Focus: Diego led a campaign to add bathroom breaks at endpoints and won by presenting incident logs without blame. He worked with dispatch to pilot schedules with micro-buffers that cut late penalties and crashes. After a tech vendor pitched driver monitoring, he insisted on a policy that protects privacy and uses alerts for coaching, not punishment. He mentors younger drivers on reading passengers’ moods and de-escalation. At dawn he warms up his bus early to defog windows, a small courtesy that starts the day right.
