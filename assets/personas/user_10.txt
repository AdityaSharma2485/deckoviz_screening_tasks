Name: Alessia Romano
Age: 31
Location: Palermo, Italy
Profession: Cultural Heritage Conservator, focuses on paper and textiles, working with small museums and private archives.

Backstory: Alessia grew up in a multi-generational house where linens were cataloged like heirlooms and stories. A high school art teacher took her to a restoration studio where she watched a water-damaged map regain legibility under patient hands. She trained in chemistry to understand fibers from the inside out and apprenticed with a restorer who measured time in solvents and drying curves. She prefers the hum of dehumidifiers to the hush of galleries.

Core Motivation: To keep fragile memory usable, not just beautiful, so communities can touch their own history without fear.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears irreversible mistakes—the tear that extends, the pigment that lifts. She’s insecure about negotiating value when clients think conservation is “just cleaning.” She worries about climate control budgets for small institutions.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Natural Dye Experiments: Grows madder and weld on a balcony; tracks recipes like lab protocols.
- Sicilian Folk Dance: Weekly rehearsals keep her connected to embodied history.
- Bread Starter Exchange: Trades sourdough cultures with friends, labeling origin and temperament.

Media Diet:

- Reads JAIC (Journal of the American Institute for Conservation) and Italian conservation forums.
- Listens to "The Object Podcast" and interviews with archivists.
- Watches slow restoration videos from bookbinders to study hand rhythm.

Communication Style: Soft-spoken and exact. She uses metaphors of care—stitches, stitches undone—to explain interventions.

Quirk or Contradiction: Refuses to wear white lab coats; prefers indigo aprons because stains tell useful stories.

Bio & Current Focus: Alessia runs a small studio with light filtered through linen curtains and shelves of labeled boxes. She documents every fiber decision with photographs and marginal notes, anticipating future conservators who will judge her. After floods damaged a parish archive, she organized a volunteer triage that balanced speed with humility—airflow first, aesthetics later. She’s now building a lending library of data loggers so tiny museums can monitor humidity without big grants. A travel project takes her to hill towns to train librarians in handling techniques that prevent damage before it starts. At night she dyes test strips and listens to interviews with elders, content to stitch past and present with careful hands.
