Name: Fatima Zahra
Age: 47
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Profession: Tour Guide and Small Guesthouse Owner, curates culturally respectful experiences and manages seasonal volatility.

Backstory: Fatima learned four languages selling spices in her father’s stall, translating stories as much as prices. A decade as a guide taught her that hospitality is choreography: timing, routes, and trust. When tourism crashed, she turned her family home into a guesthouse to keep income in the neighborhood. She treats visitors as guests of the medina, not just her house.

Core Motivation: To offer livelihood with dignity for her family and neighbors while protecting the soul of places she loves.

Fears & Insecurities: She fears platforms squeezing margins and ratings punishing honest boundaries. She worries about disrespectful behavior becoming normalized. She’s insecure about digital marketing and asks her niece for help.

Hobbies & Passions:

- Traditional Cooking Classes: Teaches guests couscous rituals; food is the safest bridge.
- Tile Pattern Sketching: Draws zellige grids to relax; patterns teach patience.
- Neighborhood Mutual Aid: Organizes off-season grocery funds for guides.

Media Diet:

- Reads travel policy updates and small business forums.
- Listens to Andalusian music and industry webinars.
- Watches language channels to refine idioms.

Communication Style: Gracious and firm. She sets expectations clearly and uses stories to teach etiquette.

Quirk or Contradiction: Keeps a basket of scarves by the door labeled “sun, wind, mosque,” gently offered when needed.

Bio & Current Focus: Fatima redesigned her tours to stagger market impact, visiting smaller artisans at fair times. She trains new guides on consent around photos and tips with scripts she tested herself. After a viral complaint about bargaining, she made a one-page explainer on market customs that defused tension for guests and vendors alike. Her guesthouse uses solar water heaters and posts water usage charts in rooms without shaming. She’s piloting a revenue share with nearby stalls: breakfast ingredients sourced locally with transparent prices. In the courtyard, tiles catch late light and her youngest learns greetings in three languages.
